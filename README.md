# DHIS2 - Case 4 - Group project (2019)

## How to install & run

Do:

```
> yarn install
> yarn start
```

This will launch at `localhost:3000`.
Use thse values:

```
Server: https://debug.dhis2.org/2.32.1
Username: admin
Password: district
```

If you have any problems with `yarn start` try running `yarn start --force`.

PS! Your folders can't have spaces in them, you'll get a compiling error.

Happy coding!! :)))

## Style

To prettify all the js code in the project run `yarn run pretty`.

Commit also need to follow the standard of `type-of-commit(what-are-you-fixing): your message`

One example could be if I just implemented a feature the commit would be: `feat(cli-style): added dhis2 cli style to the project`

There is also commit hooks on the project so it will tell you if there is anything that you need to fix before you can commit.
